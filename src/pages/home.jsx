                      About our company
                      In 2014, a group of graduates of the University of Manchester led by Robert Rose was engaged in the study of the phenomenon of Bitcoin and development of new alternative cryptocurrency types. Our team includes the best specialists in economics, finance, trading as well as highly specialized technical experts.
                      Some of them already have the necessary experience and previously were involved in the development of algorithms of cryptocurrency mining. Not having the necessary technical base, we started working with investors from the United Kingdom.
                      For two years we have launched four data centers and repeatedly upgraded technical equipment, giving up graphics cards in favor of modern ASIC miners such as KnC Neptune, Bitmine.ch Avalon Clone 85GH and TerraHash DX Large. Currently our main facilities are located in London, Leeds, Thorlby and Gargrave.
